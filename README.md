# RVinci
#Rvinci is an interface dvrk with RViz. It creates a stereoscopic render window for the da Vinci viewer,
provides camera control within the RViz environment, and provides functionality for 3D cursors to manipulate
objects within the world.

The 3D cursors utilized are found here: https://github.com/aleeper/interaction_cursor_3d and are required
for RVinci.
